# Scripts for benchmarking graph summarization algorithms

Set of scripts for evaluating various graph summarization algorithms.

## The run-summary.sh script

This script runs a graph summarization algorithm on a dataset.

## The run-connectivity.sh script

This script evaluates the connectivity precision of an algorithm on a
dataset. It requires that a gold standard summary is available.

## The run-schema.sh script

This script evaluates the schema precision, i.e., precision regarding
the type and attribute information, of an algorithm on a dataset. It
requires that a gold standard summary is available.

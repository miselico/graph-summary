! FILTERS
! from Ivan Herman <ivan@w3.org>
!1. Remove a number of vocabularies from the set, mostly because they are 
! not relevant for profile prefixes. I attach, at the end of this mail, 
! the list I currently have with some extra comments, but my considerations are:
! - some vocabularies are 'ex officio' part of the default profile, ie, 
! I remove them from here. These are all relevant W3C Recommendations and notes. 
! Typical example: the rdf namespace
! - a number of W3C Uris are used that are not vocabulary prefixes, but somehow 
! they landed on the list. Typical example: the XSL
! - Sindice has a number of artifacts that should be removed from the list 
! (sindice.com, schemas.microsoft.com)

! List of vocabulary URI-s that have to be taken out from further considerations
! for various reasons...
! Note that the filtering is based on the 'find' function, ie, if the pattern is part of the URI,
! as opposed to  an exact match. Ie, for example, 
! the entry http://chem2bio2rdf.org/ filters out
! all URI-s that contain this
! text, ie, http://chem2bio2rdf.org/*
!========== Sindice artifact =================
sindice.net = -
sindice.com = -
schemas.microsoft.com = -
schemas-microsoft-com = -

! The most controversial filters. 
! The controversy may be because all of 
! these do have a high score if not filtered out


! ========== CONTROVERSIAL FILTERS ===========
! RSS 1.0 usage is going down,
! and is probably of no use for RDFa any more...
! If allowed, the vocabulary appears among the top ones, though!
purl.org/rss/1.0 = -

! Labelled as an 'extension' to FOAF,
! has a suprisingly high score in the results,
! but all documentation is in Russian only,
! which limits its usage for a generic profile...
blogs.yandex.ru/schema/foaf = -

! The description says:                              
!   A unique, language-neutral, variable-sized
! identifier for a concept                                                                              
!   that can be used to refer unambiguously
! to that concept across OWL                                                                            
!   exports or across Cyc inference engine                                                              
! It has a high score but is barely an RDFa
! related usage
sw.cyc.com/CycAnnotations_v1 = -

! This used as the ontology of Semantic
! Media Wiki export. Not of use for RDFa...

! Another interesting example is
! the collection of dbpedia ontology subclasses that should be all factored into the
! dbpedia ontology level...
! This is not systematic. If the vocabulary number are low (ie, they would not influence the final results)
! then we do not bother
